This repository contains the source code for my final bachelor thesis - Advancing Plant Phenotyping in Rangelands Through Drone-Derived Imagery and Video Data.

**CARLA** - *Cardilla Recognition and Localization Analyzer* - is a vision based approach for identifying and detecting the cardilla (*Eryngium horridum*), a plant that can be found in southern Brazil, Uruguay and central-eastern Argentina.
